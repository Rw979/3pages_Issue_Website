              <p class="Sp3">If online bullying happens to you or people around you, don’t panic. Try to save and document the evidence as much as possible. Abandon some shame of seeing the fake version of you online as much as possible. “Across all countries, just under half (46%) of women responding to the survey who had experienced online abuse or harassment said it was misogynistic or sexist in nature” (amnesty.org). What the harrasors trying to do is to shame women and ruin reputations for fun. Necessarily, seeking legal help, the legal company  <a href="https://www.boscolegal.org/blog/how-to-stop-online-harassment/">Bosco</a>gives enough attention to online harassment and is willing to help. Lastly, we want to appeal to the attention of governments and technical companies. Setting rules and boundaries to prevent these events from the beginning.</p>
