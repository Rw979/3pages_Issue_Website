    <p class="Up1">"A study of 51 countries revealed 38% of women had personally experienced online harassment. “Only 1 in 4 reported it to the relevant authorities and nearly 9 in 10 opted to limit their online activity, thereby increasing the gender digital divide.” These trends were only exacerbated during the pandemic. Another study, by the Pew Research Center, states that “women are more likely than men to report having been sexually harassed online (16% vs. 5%) or stalked (13% vs. 9%). Young women are particularly likely to have experienced sexual harassment online. Fully 33% of women under 35 say they have been sexually harassed online, while 11% of men under 35 say the same.” While the Pew Research Center data concerns the United States, it illustrates the contours of the global situation."

<p class="Up2">In 2018, women in South Korea hosted large protests about Spycam porn. Their personal information and images are largely violated under spycam.  Without permission, harassers posted women’s videos on porn websites. Due to high pressure and anxiety, many women choose to suicide. While facing digital harassment, victims are mentally vulnerable. They need help and care. “Across all countries 61% of those who said they’d experienced online abuse or harassment said they’d experienced lower self-esteem or loss of self-confidence as a result.
More than half (55%) said they had experienced stress, anxiety or panic attacks after experiencing online abuse or harassment.
63% said they had not been able to sleep well as a result of online abuse or harassment. Three-quarters (75%) in New Zealand reported this effect.
Well over half (56%) said online abuse or harassment had meant that they had been unable to concentrate for long periods of time”. (amnesty.org)
