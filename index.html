    <p>Our world is now closely related to technology. The intersection of the digital world and personal privacy is critical. This website cares about women’s privacy online as some of them are facing challenges like digital harassment and non-consensual image sharing. We want to speak out about the unfair experiences and find a way to safeguard women's privacy. The website name “eyes on you” also represents our zero tolerance and determination for justice. If you’re interested, feel free to know more about this on our website. It needs all of us to create a safe digital environment.
